EventX Studio - Final Project Documentation

Project Overview

EventX Studio is a full-stack event management system designed to streamline event organization and ticketing. Built with React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and MongoDB (database), it provides user authentication, event browsing, ticket booking, analytics, and admin management features.

Features

User authentication (login/register)
Browse events (upcoming, active, closed)
Event details (description, price, seats available, popularity)
Book tickets (seat selection, simulated payment)
View my tickets (with QR code for entry)
Notifications for upcoming events
Admin panel (event CRUD, analytics, ticket management)
Analytics charts (age, gender, interests, location)
Ticket management (allocate seats, generate QR codes for check-in)
Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT
Database: MongoDB Atlas
Architecture

The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API endpoints.
The backend uses Express to handle requests and MongoDB for data storage.
Authentication is managed using JWT tokens.
Admin features are protected by role-based access control.
